				<h3>1. Why are there watermarks after analyzing and downloading?</h3>
				<p>We can remove more than 99% watermarks of the video, but if the videos uploaded by the original author itself
					have watermarks, they cannot be removed. How to check if the original video has a watermark? Please check whether
					the video has watermark when it is playing on Tik tok.</p>

				<h3>2. Why is saving files so slow after editing?</h3>
				<p>Due to the hardware configuration of the mobile phone, the processing speed of the CPU may be slow due to the
					low CPU speed of the mobile phone with low configuration. And the mobile phone is not suitable for processing
					large audio and video files. If what you have is a long video, it is strongly recommended that you edit it on your
					computer.</p>

				<h3>3. Why does Tik Tok fail to analyze the video?</h3>
				<p>Please send us an email with Tik Tok version number, phone make and model.</p>

				<h3>4. Why does video clipping, size cropping, and pace alteration fail?</h3>
				<p>Please send us an email with your phone make and model.</p>

				<h3>5.Video save location</h3>
				<p>Open File manager,  /WatermarkRemover/Video/</p>
